New submission

I would like to submit my newly developed R package named [ROCsurf] to CRAN. 
This is my second package, and I have previously submitted a package named 
[PLindleyROC] to CRAN.

* The functions in tests/testthat/testfunction.R that were causing fails 
have been reviewed and corrected.
